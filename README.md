## About <a name = "about"></a>
The project is simply about calling an API to retrieve data which is consists of list of objects containing information of albums. Each album contains 50 items.
Each item has its own unique id and thumbnail url, url and title. There are somewhere around 3000 images and to retrieve and show these lists optimally we
need to use pagination. Using pagination we can load one album at a time and make user's UI/UX better. Once user reaches end of the list we can load another album.
To make it more efficient we have loaded thumbnail on the list and once user clicks on any item we will redirect them to detail screen which will show
image, title and index and it'll load bigger image. To enhance UX i have used some animation to show user a transition between list and a detail screen.
Implemented a splash screen where we have fetched the first item in the splash screen it self so, that user wouln't have to wait on home screen once they reach there.

## Implementations <a name = "implementations"></a>
Used two different approaches: With the fragments and With the activities.
- main -> It contains fragment approach where i have used one activity to host two fragments
HomeList and Details fragment.

- feature/with_activity -> It contains activity based approach where i have used two different activities one for the list and one for the details.
MainActivity & DetailsActivity.
